# Bob's Matching Card Game
Play a clasic matching game with a Bob's Burgers theme! Players are briefly shown the 12 cards and are able to pick two cards at a time, if they dont match they will flip back over until all pairs have been found.

## TAKEAWAY
This was a great practice in debugging. "How do I make sure only two cards are selected? That the same card can't be selected twice? That matched cards are no longer able to be selected?" It was also quite fun to implement a playful theme.
